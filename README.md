# SecureChain
Web Security Innovative Project

## Features

Blockchain based access control.

Demonstration done on a sample website to show access controls for authorisation measures. This model is built after this publication: [Blockchain for Access Control Systems](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8403.pdf). 

Further improvements can be referred to the linked document, Page 10 figure 6. It speaks about having an external system for storing attributes which could be done using [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).
